<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">PREFACE,<br>For many years the author of this pamphlet has been collecting data relative to the Catlett family of the United States. So far as our extensive investigations have been made, the only immigrants of this name to this country at any time were Col. John and his two minor sons, Nicholas and Thomas, who came over in 1650 and settled on the Rappahannock River in Virginia. Therefore every one bearing this name must trace his descent back to Col. John or his two minor sons. Mr. W. G. Stannard, Editor of the Virginia Historical Magazine and Secretary of the Virginia Historical Society-the highest authority on Virginia genealogies-entertains the same opinion. With this opinion, every one bearing this name, wherever found, has been requested by letter (sometimes several), to give all the information possessed or obtainable, of her or his branch and its history. Many of these letters are still unanswered, and therefore no additional information obtained. It is reasonably certain that a goodly number of families of this name scattered throughout the country are still unrevealed, and therefore cannot be named in these pages.<br>In all, several hundred letters have been written and many responses obtained. In addition, court records, land books and family Bibles-yes, even cemeteries, with their almost forgotten tombstones-have been levied upon for information. With all these aids, much valuable data have been collected and arranged, and, while thoroughly conscious of incompleteness, it is deemed best to publish what has been obtained.<br>When this investigation began it was deemed an easy task. Since beyond our immediate branch, few members of the Catlett names were known to us, but, as our researches extended, family after family, branch after branch, were revealed, until our correspondence extended to nearly every State in the Union. With the revelations already made, it is safe to say that the number of descendants of the original immigrant. Col. John Catlett, now living in this country reach far into thousands. The name is purely English, derived from lot-Catelot-Catlett. Its history is given in extracts from English records published elsewhere. It is impossible to give the names all in this work, since their number is large, but we wish return here grateful thanks contributed in towards accomplishment work herein The hope is entertained that recital of virtues of our ancestors may every inspire living with fresh determination excel in good work which goes to make "perfect men and women." <A HREF="../sources.html#4534"><sup>4534</sup></a></font></p>
