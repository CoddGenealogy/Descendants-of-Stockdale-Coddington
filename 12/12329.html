<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">First record of Gerhard is his marriage in Hilgenroth, Germany where he had lived since 1685.  Marriage and Baptisms are  at the Lutheran Church in Dickshied, Germany.<br><br>Before leaving Germany for America, Gerhard asked the Mayor for a testimony of his character.  Testimonial abstract:  "There appeared before us the worthy Gerhardt Scheffer and his wedded housewife Anna Maria, residing in the Kersey Bell Zorn called Hilgert Dorf, and well endowed, and the above Gerhardt Scheffer is of good character.  He requests that a testimonial of his good character be given of us as Mayor and Court of the whole congregation and all the neighbors of the whole district.  And as Mayor, Court, and all his neighbors, we give this testimony with truthfulness and with our names subscribed and with the impress of our usual court seal....he has lived with us in Hilgert Dorf with his housewife 24 years and conducted himself well...entirely satisfied with him...pleased if it had been God's will that he remain longer here.  Hence we give the above named Gerhardt Scheffer and his housewife and their two children this testimony of their good conduct....done in the year 1709 the 26th day of May. " (Bennet, A.F.: Advanced Genealogical Research, pg. 229)<br><br>In 1709 he and his wife and two children were listed in the 5th party of Palatines in Holland, on the ship of Capt. Willian Koby, to sail to America.<br><br>In 1711, Gerhard was among the Palatine volunteers in the Canadian Expedition against France.<br><br>On Oct. 19, 1723, he was one of the original patentees of a 12,700 acre Patent near the Mohawk River in Albany Co., NY.  Gerhard did not draw lots but kept all of his share in the undivided lands of the Patent. (Stone Arabia).  On April 5, 1742,  Ludwig Casselman sold half of the yet undivided 28th share of Stone Arabia, inherited from his father-in-law.</font></p>
