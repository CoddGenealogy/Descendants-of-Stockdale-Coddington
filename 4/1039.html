<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">RECOLLECTIONS: According to a letter from Dr. Mount Johnson of Venango, Crawford County, Penn., dated 2 Feb 1911: "As the tradition went, Moses Conger and a relative unknown, left New Jersey and started west. Moses Conger had his leg broken somewhere in the mountains, between New Jersey and Wheeling, West Virginia [sic, Virginia]. Whether the relative deserted him or was killed by the Indians, Moses never knew. . "He was taken in by a Quaker family, where he remained about a year, and then floated down the Ohio River to some place in Kentucky. Of his subsequent career, nothing is known until he went with other volunteers called for by Governor Isaac Sheel, to go to Fort Washington (now Cincinnati) and from there with 'Mad' Anthony Wayne, to the balled of Fallen Timbers in August 1794. . "On his return he was favorably impressed with the lands in Mill Creek Valley in Hamilton County, Ohio, and tried to buy a quarter section of land, but did not have money enough. However, in the spring of 1795 he removed from Kentucky to Ohio, and squatted on some land there, and worked for the Ludlow family, at or near Cincinnati.<br>  "In 1798, his wife died and was buried where not stands the First Presbyterian Church, near the corner of 4th and Main Streets. About 1841, the bodies were removed from this burial ground, and in the removal of bodies, the charts and files were lost.<br>  "In 1804, Moses Conger removed to the Bray place near Westwood, as it is now called.<br>  "In 1809, he died west of the great Miami River, near the present town of Harrison, Ohio, practically on the Indiana line (of milk sickness)." <br>  Dr. Johnson referred to his great uncle, Daniel, so his grandmother must have been Ara Conger, who married John Banos. His mother died of Asiatic Cholera on 12 Jul 1850 and was buried in Banos Graveyard. She was born in 1813 and married in 1834. [Note: Mrs. Leonard is confused about the relationship of Dr. Mount Johnson. His mother, Ara Conger, married Henry Johnson. His grandparents were: John Hendricks Conger and Nancy Grady and his great grandparents were Moses Conger and Miss Hendricks. This conclusion reached based on where Ara Conger's brother, Daniel McFarlane Conger, fits in the family tree. REH] . He mentioned visiting the widow of his mother's [note listed in CFA I, p. 378, as g/mother's] brother, Daniel McFarlane Conger, living at Peoria, Illinois and his mother's only sister, Caroline Conger Wallace, who was buried in Lincoln, Ill. When the above letter was written from Nashville, Tenn. Dr. Johnson was 76 years of age. <A HREF="../sources.html#1237"><sup>1237</sup></a></font></p>
