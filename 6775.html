<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">The family origins of Dr. Jeremiah Ayres are a mystery. He was born in Westmoreland Co., Pennsylvania on 25 Jun 1831. John Ayers and Frances Snyder may have been his parents, but that is based only on presence of John Ayers family in the area and reasonable dates. In the 1840 Westmoreland Co. census a William Ayres appears and had a son aged 5-10 years.<br>  A "Jerm.- Ayers" appears in the New Alexandria, Pennsylvania 1850 census in the household of John Reed (household 924_945, age 34, prof. = "Mer[chant]", no real property worth, wife Eliza 30, Ann (10), Henry (7), illegible daughter (5), Eliza (2), all born Pennsylvania), Jeremiah was listed as age 19, profession "Clerk," born Pennsylvania.  John Reed appears in the 1840 New Alexandria census with a household of himself and one female, both aged 20-30--nobody else.<br>  Jeremiah carried with him a "Testimonial" dated 20 March 1853 which stated, "We the undersigned being personally acquainted with Jeremiah Ayres for the last four years know him to be a young man of  good moral character honest and industrious careful and diligent in business and do therefore cheerfully recommend him to any person to whom he may apply for employment , or any society of a moral character to which he may apply." This could be interpreted to mean that although he was born in Westmoreland Co., he did not reside there during the 1830's and 40's but rather returned in 1849. The undersigned were John Mowrer [46, neighbor in 1850 census], Geo Gallagher [Thos. is a neighbor in 1850 census], J. C. Rochester [neighbor in 1850 census], Joseph Cook  [53, neighbor in 1850 census], Robert Raineys, Matthew Shields [28, no occupation, son of Samuel, p. 377 Salem, 1850 Census], Adam Torrance [51, clergyman, O.P.P. in 1850 census, in Salem], Garret Crusan  [28, tailor, neighbor in 1850 census, p. 414], Daniel Baldrige  [49 neighbor in 1850 census], and John H. Reed [37 and landloard in 1850 census].  Jeremiah thus had asked neighbors of John Reed to sign the  testimonial.<br>  A letter by Jeremiah's daughter Eva says he left home at age 13 [thus about 1844, possibly orphaned?]. Another from his youngest daughter Hazel said that he left home to pursue an education, which his parents opposed. His home town may have been New Alexandria (New Alexandria Borough); nearby towns are Greenwald, Shieldsburg, Crabtree, and Old Crabtree. He attended Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania in 1855 (or possibly just its preparatory school), and thereafter taught school in Michigan for six months, where, as he said, it was so cold he "slept between feather beds..." He then attended medical college in Cincinnati, which also happened to be experiencing a cholera epidemic. He said the waiters would look at him amazed when he asked for fresh vegetables. He was always very fond of cucumbers.<br>  Jeremiah was at the "Eclectic College of Medicine" in Cincinnati, OH, in at least 1855 (graduated in 1855, age 23,) and 1858. He also attended Newton's Clinical Inst. in 1855.<br>  He went to Ann Arbor, Michigan to teach school for 3 months in the winter of 1854-55, and also taught school in the vicinity of Mt. Sterling and Kiddville, Kentucky from 1855 to 1856.<br>  Peter D. Coddington interviewed B. C. Edwards, a descendant of A. W. Williams, who said he came into College Hill on a mule with two saddle bags containing all he possessed. A. W. Williams and J. Ayres were partners in a drug store in College Hill, Kentucky. and Williams bought both the business and later the house that J. Ayres built in the 1880's, and in which B. C. Edwards was born and raised.<br>  He married Margaret Eliza Douthitt in 1863 and lived and worked in College Hill, Madison Co., KY, as a physician, later teaching at the Texas Seminary (the earlier name for College Hill), later called "Ayres Academy," and finally "College Hill Seminary."   According to his diary (p. 367), the "board of education of the K. Conf. M.E.C. changed the name of Texas Seminary to Ayres Academy."<br>  On his marriage record (Book 7, 249) it says he was born in Westmoreland Co., Pennsylvania, 1831. His diary records "June 18 Married at 8pm to Miss Margaret E. Douthit Daughter of B. J. + Armelda E. Douthit age 14 years + 11 days.  It is my great desire that I may always treat her as a husband Should a wife God being my helper I pray so to do.  We were married by Frank Johns Methodist Preacher.  Everything was done up the best of styles.  Brideman James Lewis Bride Maid Mollie Blanton." (p. 342). Family legend states that the Douthitt's permitted the marriage of their much younger daughter to Jeremiah because they feared for her safety during the Civil War.<br>  In 1865-66 Jeremiah moved for about a year to Thorntown, Boone Co., Indiana, possibly as a result of a severe illness that lasted from Oct 1864 to Feb 1865.<br>  After the Civil War, Jeremiah and Margaret Eliza had a black boy in their home (listed as 6 years old and white on 1870 Census, b. abt 1864), named Charles, who grew up to marry Charlotte Douthitt on 19 Oct 1892 (Bond by Silas Douthitt, consent by Aaron Douthitt, father of the bride). Also there were Elizabeth Miller (white) and Charles (10) and Lucinda (13) Bolton [Blanton?], black, these latter three all illiterate.<br>  Five households later (157_157) appears Amos Douthet, black, aged 45, farm laborer, personal worth $100, illiterate, with wife Agnes, 40, and children Sarah (16), Mariah (13), Elizabeth (11), Malinda (9), Sharlot (7), Sily (5), Wilson (4), and Eliza 3).<br>  Aaron Douthfit is listed four times (Daughitt/Doughfit/Doutfitt/Douthitt) as a private in Company G, 122nd Regiment, U. S. Army colored troops, and in the 18-24 Sept. 1864 entry, p. 349, Jeremiah's diary says "Got notice to Aaron as being drafted." Jeremiah's diary also refers to Aaron in a legal matter. A slave named Aaron was bequeathed to Benjamin Jameson Douthitt by his wife's aunt, Charlotte Jameson, in 1841. Although Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on 1 Jan 1863, it applied only to states in rebellion (Kentucky was loyal), Slaves in Kentucky were freed on 18 Dec. 1865, after 27 of the 35 states ratified the 13th amendment ("Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."). Kentucky rejected this amendment on on 24 Feb. 1865, but later passed it on 18 Mar 1876. On 15 Jun 1864, Congress gave African Americans equal pay, arms, equipment, and medical services and freed the enslaved wives and children of black soldiers serving with Union forces.<br>  At various times in his life he belonged to several fraternal orders: the Masons, Odd Fellows, and Sons of Temperance. <A HREF="sources.html#3485"><sup>3485</sup></a><A HREF="sources.html#3578"><sup>,3578</sup></a><A HREF="sources.html#3579"><sup>,3579</sup></a><A HREF="sources.html#3580"><sup>,3580</sup></a></font></p>
