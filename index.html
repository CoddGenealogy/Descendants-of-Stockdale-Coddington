<h2>Descendants of Stockdale Coddington</h2>
<!/center>
Stockdale Coddington (1569-1650) was the earliest Coddington of this line to immigrate to America. His son John (1605-1655) arrived first, in May 1635 at Boston, Massachusetts with his wife Mary on the "Susan and Ellen;" Stockdale arrived about five years later. John's only known surviving child John (1653-aft. 1715) moved to Woodbridge, New Jersey around 1680; subsequent Coddington lines root in these New Jersey ancestors. A few other Coddingtons have immigrated to North America since then and left extant lines (see "CODDINGTON, Unrelated Immigrants" in the Surnames/Names indices), but, in general, nearly all North American Coddingtons descend from Stockdale. Coddington is an uncommon surname. In the 2010 U.S. Census, 3,871 (0.0013%) of the population were Coddingtons (surname rank 8,509 of 29,474,255). The 1950 census lists 876 Coddington, Corrington, Cottington, and Cuddington households out of 44 million. This database currently contains information on roughly 5,400 Coddingtons and variant surnames, 4,000 born before 1930, and ca. 5,400 matrilineal descendants of Stockdale. Pre-1900 Coddingtons are emphasized. This website is more an on-going database than a finished work; the notes are particularly rough.  In general, non-Coddington surnames are followed for one or two generations only. JAMESON, CUSHMAN, DOUTHITT (DOUTHIT, DOUTHAT, DOUTHET) and AYRES also figure prominently. If you find errors, have information to add, or know of Coddington descendants of Stockdale not shown here, please let me know at the address below.
