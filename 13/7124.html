<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">He was one of the earliest settlers of the original township, and occupied a commanding position in civil and military affairs. He was colonel of the north or upper Middlesex regiment and was vested with unusual authority by the government of the province. In the successive wars with the Indians he was in command over a considerable territory and at all times secured the confidence of the government.<br><br>In 1676 he was appointed superintendent over the friendly Indians colonized at Dunstable. In this mission, Robert Parris was his deputy or assistant.<br><br>In the commission of King James II. to Governor Joseph Dudley, 1686, he is named one of the councilors. The same council was continued through the administration of Governor Andros. Crowning the honors of a serviceable career he was a judge of the court of Middlesex county from 1702 to 1719.<br><br>In the superior qualities of his mind and character in the activities of his useful life and in the achievements of his descendants is found the inviting and substantial material for a volume of local history<br><br>Hon. Jonathan Tyng married Sarah Usher, daughter of Hezekiah and Frances Usher of Boston. A record of her death has not been discovered. She was the mother of his children. He married, second, in Boston, May 30, 1706, Sarah (Gibbons-Richards) Davie. She was a daughter of William Gibbons, born in Hartford, August 17, 1645. She married James Richards of Hartford, who died July 29, 1680; she married, second, Humphrey Davie of Boston, his second wife. She died at Woburn, February 28, 1712-3 "in the 69 year of her age." Gravestone at Woburn. In Massachusetts Historical collections, sixth series, Vol II., page 298, is found an item by Samuel Sewall: "March 4 1713-14 went to Woburn to attend the funeral of Aunt Tyng being his second wife." <br>He married, third, Judith (Reyner) Fox, a daughter of Rev. John Reyner of Plymouth, Mass., and Dover, N. H., and widow of Rev. Jabez Fox of Woburn. <br>He removed from Dunstable to Woburn 1712 or 1713, and there died January 19, 1723-4. His widow died June 5, 1736, aged 98 years. Gravestones at Woburn. <A HREF="../sources.html#3926"><sup>3926</sup></a></font></p>
