<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font SIZE="+1"><strong>General Notes: </strong></font></p>
<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">INMAN, JOHN (1805-Mar. 30, 1850), journalist and editor, the son of William and Sarah Inman, was born in Utica, N. Y. (F. B. Hough, A History of Lewis County, 1860, p. 124). About 1812 William Inman removed with his family to New York City. Although without an adequate formal education, John, toward the close of 1823, went to North Carolina, where he taught school for two years. After spending a year in Europe, he returned to New York and from 1829 to 1833 practiced law, but owing either to a small clientele or to a love of literature, inherited, perhaps, from his father, who was a gentleman of education and culture, he gradually drifted into journalistic work. From 1828 to 1831, and later in 1835 and 1836, Inman served on the editorial staff of the New York Mirror, a literary magazine founded in 1823 by George P. Morris. For a short time in 1828 he seems also to have had an editorial charge in the New York Standard. About 1837 he accepted a more important appointment as an assistant editor of the Commercial Advertiser, and with the death of William L. Stone, the editor-in-chief, in 1844, assumed its complete editorial control, which he retained until shortly before his death. With the establishment in 1844 of the Columbian Lady's and Gentelman's Magazine, Inman was appointed editor of the periodical, later having as an associate Robert A. West. This periodical was fortunate in numbering among its contributors such writers as H. T. Tuckerman, Mrs. Lydia Sigourney, and Edgar Allan Poe. Duyckinck asserts that Inman himself on one occasion wrote an entire number of the periodical. Inman's connection with the magazine ceased in 1838. He was also for a time a contributor to the Spirit of the Times and the New York Review. <br>Thus Inman's life was largely spent in the obscurity of editorial offices, where he passed an anonymous literary existence. Still, the periodicals and miscellanies of his day reveal a number of signed articles which aid us in estimating the man's literary ability. These prose tales vary much in subject matter and artistic value. "Old Graham the Beggar," in The Christian Souvenir (Boston, 1843) is a feeble, sentimental effusion in a purely didactic vein. Of slightly greater artistic merit is "The Sudden and Sharp Doom," a story published in The Gift for 1843 (Philadelphia, 1842), which also included the first printing of Poe's "Pit and the Pendulum." In "Early Love and Constancy" (New York Mirror, Apr. 2, 1831)Inman presents a sentimental tale, tempered, in the early Knickerbocker manner, by elements of burlesque. A quaint little sketch, in places worthy of Irving himself, whose style Inman has obviously sought to imitate, is "The Little Old Man of Coblentz," contributed anonymously to The Talisman for MDCCCXXIX (New York, 1828). Inman also wrote for an edition of Samuel Maunder's Treasury of History, published in New York in 1845, a sketch of American history. <br>In 1833 Inman married Miss Fisher, the sister of several comedians of that name popular at the Park Theatre. Although greatly overshadowed in reputation by his more accomplished brother, Henry Inman, 1801-1846 [q.v.], the painter, he yet seems to have been liked by his contemporaries. He belonged to the "Sketch Club," which included among its members Bryant, Halleck, and Verplanck. "Halleck," says J. G. Wilson, "esteemed him highly as a genial companion and an accomplished littérateur." <br>[Brief Sketches of Inman's life are to be found in E. A. and G. L. Duyckinck, Cyc. of Am. Lit. (ed. 1875), II, 244, the Internat. Miscellany (Internat. Monthly Mag.), Oct. 1850, and J. G. Wilson, Bryant and His Friends (1886), pp. 408-09. Facts regarding some of his editorial connections are included in F. L. Mott, A Hist. of Am. Magazines, 1741-1850 (1930).] <br>N.F.A. <A HREF="../sources.html#4081"><sup>4081</sup></a></font></p>
