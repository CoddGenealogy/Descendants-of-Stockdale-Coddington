<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">ROBERT BARRETT BROWNING.<br>Son of the poet, Robert Browning, and Elizabeth Barrett.<br>Born in 1849, at Florence, Italy. <br><br>Robert Barrett Browning, born three years after his parents' marriage, was their idol. His mother called him "Pinino," which is the soft Italian for "Little Darling." When he was five years old he wrote some verses, which gave promise for the future. His mother lived until he was twelve years old, and upon her death consigned him to the care of his aunt, Sarianna Browning, with the injunction, "Always to be a friend to my Pinino"; and this promise she faithfully carried out. After his mother's death Pen Browning was sent to England to Christ College. But his deep love for art caused his father to send him to Antwerp and Paris to study drawing and sculpture. He settled down in Paris with his father and his aunt for a while, and then his father purchased the old Rezzonico Palace on the Grand Canal in Venice. This house was built in the seventeenth century for the family of Pope Clement XIII. <br><br>In the year 1885, Pen Browning met Fanny Coddington, of New York City, while she was traveling abroad. She was young, pretty, a blond, and very rich. Her father lived at 41 Fifth Avenue, New York City. Young Mr. Browning, who was then thirty-six years old, admired her, and in 1887 he married and took her to his father's house in Venice to live. They lived there very happily together for several years. Mr. Browning pursued his vocation as an artist, and was fond of painting beautiful women. Among his models was one known as Ginevra, and Mrs. Browning, becoming jealous of her, left her husband and returned to New York. Here she was very unhappy, lost interest in society, and spent her time in connection with the mission work of Grace Church in visiting the poor and suffering, especially the Italians of the East side. Meanwhile Mr. Browning entertained the tenderest regard for his wife and did all he could to reconcile her. In 1898, Ginevra married an Italian, and in 1900 she died. After this event, Mr. Browning succeeded in reconciling his wife and she returned to his home and they live happily together there now. The aunt, Sarianna, died in 1903, always faithful to her trust, and beloved by her friends. <br><br>and...<br>Robert Browning was justly proud and very fond of his son's lovely American wife, Fanny Coddington, of New York. She was a devoted daughter to him. It was in her home in Venice, Palazzo Rezzonico, that the poet died. In a letter from her dated January 4 she writes some particulars of his illness and death, which she says was "a fitting close in every respect to such a noble life.... He had been so full of life and was so happy in our new home that when his illness came it was like a thunder-bolt out of a clear sky. From the first the doctor told me that his heart was weak; he got better of the bronchitis, but day by day, without pain, he became weaker and more weak until the end.... He was glad that his illness had happened in Venice, and not in London; and he was touchingly grateful for all that we tried to do for him to have him once more well again: God knows it was our best. But his time to go had come, and we all feel grateful that it came as it did, that his falling asleep was so peaceful. The coincidence of 'Asolando' coming out the day he left this earth seemed most appropriate, with its prophetic epilogue ! The ceremony at Westminster Abbey, last Tuesday, was beyond words impressive and as one would have desired it to be in every way. Pen was immensely touched by the fitting music to his mother's beautiful words.... Poor Aunt Sariana! Her loss has made a great change in her she has felt it terribly. She has been very, very ill from the shock. She is better now, though she hardly leaves her room yet." <A HREF="../sources.html#930"><sup>930</sup></a></font></p>
