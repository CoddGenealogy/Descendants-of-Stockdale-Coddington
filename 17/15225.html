James ZBreechin, Priestof Caple Parish in Westmoreland Co., VA. Evidence stated that "David Crawford, late of the Parish of St. Peter's in the County of New Kent, was in hi slifetime seized in fee simple, or and in one neck of land, lying and being in the Parish of St. Paul's in the County of Hanover, containing about five hundred acres, and so being seized, by his certain poll, bearing the date of May 21, 1691, for the natural love and affection which he bore his daughter, Sarah, did give the said land unto his faughter and the heirs of her body, as by said deed more fully may appear, and the said Sarah entered and by virtue of said deed was seized, and intermarried with one Thomas Poindexter, deceased, and by him had issue, John Poindexter, and has since intermarried with one James Breechin, likewise deceased..." It appears it was probably Sarah's dowry land that Rev. Breechin had willed his stepsons John and Thomas Poindexter prior to the Minister's death in 1721. <A HREF="../sources.html#5778"><sup>5778</sup></a></font></p>
