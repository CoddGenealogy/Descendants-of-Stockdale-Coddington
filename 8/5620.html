<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><font SIZE="-1">"ISAAC MILLER SR.<br>ASHLAND TIDINGS: Ashland, Oregon Friday March 1, 1873.<br><br>Died---Miller at their residence in Ashland, Oregon, on February 26, 1878 of lung fever, Isaac Miller and Elizabeth, his wife; the former about 11 o'clock and the latter at 2 o'clock p.m.<br><br>Mrs. Miller whose maiden name was Elizabeth Coddington, was born in the state of Tennessee, January 18, 1805, and Mr. Miller in the same state on February 8, 1806. They married December 20th, 1827. They started for Oregon from Indiana in 1847, remained over the winter in Missouri and in the fall of 1848 arrived in Oregon and settled in Marion County. From Marion, they moved to Clackamas, then to Linn and from that county to Jackson in 1867 and settled in Ashland where they made their home until the day of their death.<br><br>Isaac Miller was a man of strong force of character, generous almost to a fault and was outspoken and courageous in what he conceived to be his duty, and wherever he resided his influence was always felt on the side of right and justice and in the interest of good morals and enlightenment.<br><br>Mrs. Miller was possessed of all the attributes of a worthy Christian woman, an affectionate wife and mother, and as a faithful helpmate, always supported and encouraged her husband in the performance of every laudable purpose.<br><br>In our village, they won the undivided respect of the people, by their charity, piety and sterling worth, and the hearts of all who knew them. All are saddened by the thought that they are gone from us forever. It seems that after more than half a century of the kindliest association, bearing mutually the sorrows and disappointments and sharing alike the comforts and joys of life, they should at last, and almost at the same moment, bid adieu to the things of earth, and together go forward to test the realities of another and better world.<br><br>For more than thirty years they had been exemplary members of the Christian Church, and both died in the hope of a happy immortality. On Wednesday afternoon they were buried in the same grave. About five hundred present to witness the sad rites." <A HREF="../sources.html#2407"><sup>2407</sup></a></font></p>
